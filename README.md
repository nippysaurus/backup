# BACKUP

You know when a codebase is still in its infancy and you havent got version control yet, but you want to make a crazy change which might just break everything? Well thats what this script is for.

As long as its in your `$PATH` just run `backup` from your project directory to quickly make a backup in `~/.backup/<project_name>_<timestamp>.zip`

Then you can make your crazy changes and everyone is happy :)
